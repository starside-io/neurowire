# Recipes

Practical end-to-end workflows. Each one is a short sequence of commands you can copy. They assume the `neurowire` CLI (and, where noted, `neurowire-web`) are installed. See [Installation](/guide/installation).

## Watch a site and push new posts to Slack

Long-poll a mesh and deliver only the entries you have not seen yet to a Slack incoming webhook. The `--state` file makes restarts skip already-reported items.

```bash
neurowire --mesh ai-news.json \
  --watch --interval 15m \
  --state ~/.neurowire-seen.json \
  --sink https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000/B000/XXXX
```

Swap the sink URL for a Discord webhook (`https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...`) or any generic endpoint (which receives the JSON Feed as `application/feed+json`). The sink kind is auto-detected from the URL. See [CLI sinks](/guide/cli#sinks).

## Build a daily HTML news page from a construct

A [construct](/concepts/constructs) bundles several meshes. Render it to a self-contained page (all CSS inline, no external requests).

Single combined page (every entry tagged by its mesh):

```bash
neurowire-web --construct daily.json --combined --out public/index.html
```

Multi-page "repo of feeds" (an overview plus one page per mesh) into a directory:

```bash
neurowire-web --construct daily.json --out public/
```

Limit to recent items with `--since` or `--today`:

```bash
neurowire-web --construct daily.json --combined --since 24h --out public/index.html
```

## Migrate subscriptions via OPML

Import an OPML export from another reader into a Neurowire mesh, then export it back out if you need to.

Import (the mesh name comes from `--name`, else the OPML title):

```bash
neurowire opml import subscriptions.opml -o my-reader.json --name "My Reader"
```

Use the resulting mesh like any other:

```bash
neurowire --mesh my-reader.json --format json --limit 20
```

Export a mesh (or construct) back to OPML 2.0:

```bash
neurowire opml export --mesh my-reader.json > my-reader.opml
```

See [opml subcommands](/guide/cli#opml-export).

## Add a tap for a feed-less site

A [tap](/concepts/taps) teaches Neurowire to read a site with no RSS/Atom feed. Let `tap doctor` propose one, save it, then use it.

```bash
# propose a template and save it where Neurowire looks for taps
neurowire tap doctor https://example.com/blog \
  > ~/.config/neurowire/taps/example.com.json

# now the site resolves like any feed
neurowire https://example.com/blog --format atom
```

You can also load a tap ad hoc with `--taps <path>` or via the `NEUROWIRE_TAPS` env var. See [tap doctor](/guide/cli#tap-doctor).

## Convert any feed to RSS 2.0

Normalize any source (RSS, Atom, JSON Feed, or an HTML page) and re-emit it as RSS 2.0.

```bash
neurowire https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything/ --format rss > willison.rss
```

The same `--format rss` works on a mesh or a (flattened) construct:

```bash
neurowire --mesh ai-news.json --format rss --limit 25 > ai-news.rss
```

See [RSS format](/formats/rss).
